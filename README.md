This is my stupid passion project that ive been working on since 2023 *WOW*
current "release" of reverse is reborn
this reborn thing goes from a fully fledged cpp program to a do it yourself thingy in python
everything is a giant work in progress, if there are any bugs feel free to open an issue or pull request.

# New stuff.

sewer v1 has been released!

sewer is the new package manager for reverse. its alot better than spm but you do need spm to install sewer.

sewer uses the same packagelist thingy that spm does, so you can install your normal spm packages tru sewer.
SPM WILL NOT BE UPDATED PAST THIS POINT. ALL UPDATES WILL BE DONE TO SEWER.

coming up: actual base v1 that isnt just renaming some stuff.
