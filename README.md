Reverse has been my main passionproject since early 2023 (wow.) 
this is a little operating system thingy inside your terminal!
with reverse reborn, i released a simple package manager called SPM (stupid package manager)
current "release" of reverse is reborn. it makes everything in seperate files, adds new features and is on python unlike reverse7, which was on c++

# PLEASE CHECK THIS OUT! THESE ARE THE UPDATES!

base v0.9.0 has been released!
it adds a new fallback shell and renames some stuff.

minifetch port will be fixed once i am done with spm core v2



coming up: Stupid Package Manager Core v2 a full rewrite to spm that works properly.

I DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT SPM CORE v2 AND THE MINIFETCH PORT FIXES WILL COME SOON.
