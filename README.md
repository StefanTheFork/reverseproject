# whats this reverse project all about?
this is my little stupid passion project........

its a simulation of an os because i wanted to piss of my teacher one day.
its a pointless thing really, but i enjoy working on it!




# New stuff.
## there is now a devbuild base

you can also install it tru spm, but i reccomend using sewer.

install it using ```sewer -i base-devbuild```

to install sewer run ```spm install``` and type ```sewer```

sewer v1 has been released!

sewer is the new package manager for reverse. its alot better than spm but you do need spm to install sewer.

sewer uses the same packagelist thingy that spm does, so you can install your normal spm packages tru sewer.

SPM WILL NOT BE UPDATED PAST THIS POINT. ALL UPDATES WILL BE DONE TO SEWER.

coming up: devbuild bugfixes and config features :)
