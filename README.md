Reverse has been my main passionproject since early 2023 (wow.) 
this is a little operating system thingy inside your terminal!
with reverse reborn, i released a simple package manager called SPM (stupid package manager)
current "release" of reverse is reborn. it makes everything in seperate files, adds new features and is on python unlike reverse7, which was on c++

# PLEASE CHECK THIS OUT! THESE ARE THE UPDATES!

base v0.9.0 has been released!
it adds a new fallback shell and renames some stuff.

oh btw, theres a new package....
minifetch! its a port of penguinguy's miniOS sysfetch to reverse

(its not in the fallback shell by default, you have to install it manually and add it to the fallback shell manually.)

there are some problems, but the minifetch port will be fixed once i am done with upcoming updates and adding new shells n stuff


coming up: Stupid Package Manager Core v2 a full rewrite to spm that works properly.

I DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT SPM CORE v2 AND THE MINIFETCH PORT FIXES WILL COME SOON.
