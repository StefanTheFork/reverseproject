# whats this reverse project all about?
this is my little stupid passion project........

its a simulation of an os because i wanted to piss of my teacher one day.
its a pointless thing really, but i enjoy working on it!

## New stuff/info
base v1 devbuild 2

<img width="1056" height="212" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45f1681a-1547-4bd5-95db-db1035872979" />
To use your old dev_config.txt just rename it to config.rvrs and it SHOULD work.

## new packages
Cowsay ```sewer -i cowsay```

## what is sewer?

sewer is the new package manager for reverse. its alot better than spm but you do need spm to install sewer.

sewer uses the same package folder that spm uses, so you can install anything tru spm and sewer

SPM WILL NOT BE UPDATED PAST THIS POINT. ALL UPDATES WILL BE DONE TO SEWER.

## coming in the next few devbuilds (ls mv and rename will be coming to base v1, there wont be a devbuild 3 for v1)
envy - gnu nano like editor
ls - list current folder
mv - move file from somewhere to somewhere 
rename - rename file/folder/anything
quickedit - use it to quickly add an entry to your config *I AM NOT COMPLETELY SURE ON WETHER I WANT TO ADD THIS OR NOT.*
dyanmic-prompt - installable trough sewer
dymamic-prompt-colorized - installable trough sewer, does not need default dynamic prompt
```sewer -ls``` - lists currently avalible packages
```sewer -d <pkg>``` - deletes selected package
```config clean``` - removes residual commands from config *I AM NOT COMPLETELY SURE ON WETHER I WANT TO ADD THIS OR NOT.*
