Reverse has been my main passionproject since early 2023 (wow.) 
this is a little operating system thingy inside your terminal!
with reverse reborn, i released a simple package manager called SPM (stupid package manager)
current "release" of reverse is reborn. it makes everything in seperate files, adds new features and is on python unlike reverse7, which was on c++

base v1 has been released!
it renames pretty much everything, has native spm support and a new fallback ascii logo

ALSOOOOOOOOOO THE NEW SPM REWRITE IS HERE....... but not really(?)
theres a "menu" for installing packages... but not really.

theres also a WORKING menu for updating spm and the core... so thats cooler

now, the reason why this isnt actually a full rewrite but rather a sloppily trhrown togheder feature half made by repurposed chatgpt slop and half reading what old spm was....... 
is because the spm full rewrite will be a whole different package manager. yes reverse will have 2 package managers. no, spm will not be updated past this point.
