Yet again another rebrand of the reverse thing, wow so cool.
we went from uhhhhhh GlassOS, to reverse7 to reverse. (unofficial) to reverse reborn. such cool naming.
the reason for the reborn is............... uh like its a kernel now.... forget the everythinginonefile mindset. its all just.... kernel.py, spm.py and shell.py.
## YES YOUR HEARD IT RIGHT, ITS A KERNEL NOW!.
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW
## on python.
EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
## pros:
everything is easy to edit, update, fix

COOL SHELLS

AMAZING RICING CAPABILITIES
