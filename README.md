To use your old dev_config.txt just rename it to config.rvrs and it SHOULD work.

sewer v1 has been released!

sewer is the new package manager for reverse. its alot better than spm but you do need spm to install sewer.

sewer uses the same packagelist thingy that spm does, so you can install your normal spm packages tru sewer.

SPM WILL NOT BE UPDATED PAST THIS POINT. ALL UPDATES WILL BE DONE TO SEWER.

coming up: ```sewer -ru <pkg>``` and ```config clean``` that removes residual stuff from deleted apps. + ```reload/reload-debug``` rename to ```config reload/config reload-debug```
